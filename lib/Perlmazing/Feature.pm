=head1 NAME

Perlmazing::Feature - Use strict and warnigns and enable all modern features from your Perl version in a single call.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This aims to be the equivalent of:

	use strict;
	use warnings;
	use $]; # your Perl version - this doesn't work as written, by the way.
	
Instead of that, all you have to do is:

	use Perlmazing::Feature;
	
And, if you want the same thing for any module or scrit calling your module, then you can simply do this:

	use Perlmazing::Feature
	
	sub import {
		Perlmazing::Feature->import;
	}
