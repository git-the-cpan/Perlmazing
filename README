Perlmazing - A collection of helper functions powered by L<Perlmazing::Engine>.

This module is the first practical example of a module powered by Perlmazing::Engine.
It's a collection of helper functions that are loaded only when actually used, making it
extremely fast to load and efficient to run. This manual will show you how to use this
module and what its helper functions do, but you should look at Perlmazing::Engine to
understand how it's being used and maybe look at the source code of this module to see
how simple it was to implement Perlmazing::Engine for this example.

As an additional benefit, this module automatically uses and imports Perlmazing::Feature,
which basically will enable strict and warnings FATAL => 'all', along with the most recent
features your version of Perl can enable.

How this module works at the end:

    use Perlmazing;
    
    # First of all, Perlmazing::Feature is automatically imported,
    # so warnings and strict are automatically enabled and also
    # any features that your version of Perl can have (similar to
    # "use $]", if only that was a valid call).
    
    # Now all helper functions are available. Yes, it exports
    # all symbols by default. Please read the rest of this POD
    # to understand why and when it's considered a good thing.
    
    # Now use any of the helper functions from this module freely!
